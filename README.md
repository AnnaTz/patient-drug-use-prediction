This project was developed for the 'Data Mining and Machine Learning I' course, part of the MSc in Data Analytics at the University of Glasgow in 2023. It constructs a predictive model to assess the likelihood of drug use among individuals, leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic, psychological, and behavioral features. 

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on 600 individuals, described by 11 features related to drug use. The 'Class' column indicates the drug use status: "Never Used" (0) or "Used at some point" (1).

## Project Objectives

- To conduct exploratory analysis and identify factors influencing drug use.
- To apply and evaluate various classification techniques.
- To select the best model based on performance metrics and discuss its implications.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need R and RStudio installed on your computer to work with the R Markdown document. The document will automatically prompt for the installation of the necessary R packages. 

### Running the Project

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Markdown file (`drug_use_prediction.Rmd`) in RStudio.
3. Run the document to perform the analysis. The R Markdown format allows for a seamless integration of code execution and narrative, making it easy to follow the analysis process and results.

## Analysis and Results

Follow the instructions and code within the R Markdown document to explore the dataset, apply classification models, and interpret the results. The document is structured to guide you through the analysis, from data preparation to model evaluation.
